# Shared Input Component
The Shared Input Component is a React-based application designed to manage multiple dynamic forms. It supports adding, submitting, and removing forms with real-time validation and animations for notifications. The project uses React Toastify for displaying beautiful popups to inform users about form actions like successful submission, missing fields, or form removal. Each formâ€™s data is stored in localStorage for persistence.

# How It Works
1. Form Initialization:

* When the app loads, it retrieves previously saved forms from localStorage and initializes them.
* If no forms are found, it creates an initial blank form.
2. Form Actions:

* Add Form: Generates a new form with unique ID and empty fields.
R* emove Form: Deletes a specific form from the UI and localStorage.
* Submit Form: Validates and saves the form data to localStorage.
3. Notifications:

* Displays a success message when data is successfully submitted.
* Warns the user if they attempt to submit with empty fields.
* Confirms when a form is added or removed.
4. Data Persistence:

* Uses localStorage to save each form's data under unique keys (formData-ID).
