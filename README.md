# Shared Input Component
The Shared Input Component is a React-based application designed to manage multiple dynamic forms. It supports adding, submitting, and removing forms with real-time validation and animations for notifications. The project uses React Toastify for displaying beautiful popups to inform users about form actions like successful submission, missing fields, or form removal. Each formâ€™s data is stored in localStorage for persistence.
